# CalTrack Setup Instructions

## ðŸš€ Quick Setup

CalTrack is ready to run! Follow these steps to get started:

### 1. Supabase Database Setup

You need to create three tables in your Supabase database:

#### `workouts` table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE workouts (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  exercise_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  duration INTEGER NOT NULL,
  calories INTEGER NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### `diet` table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE diet (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  meal_name TEXT NOT NULL,
  calories INTEGER NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

#### `weight` table:
```sql
CREATE TABLE weight (
  id UUID DEFAULT gen_random_uuid() PRIMARY KEY,
  weight NUMERIC NOT NULL,
  created_at TIMESTAMP WITH TIME ZONE DEFAULT NOW()
);
```

### 2. Configure API Keys

#### Supabase Configuration:
